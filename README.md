## Overview üëì
A **full-stack**, social experiences **web application** designed by a team of **2 UX Designers & 4 Software Developers** and **built over 2 days**, as a solution to **General Assembly's Hackathon** to reimagine **pre-pandemic social activities** and **inspire togetherness**.

This was inspired by **combining AirBnB Experiences** and **Zoom Breakout rooms**. Ultimately, our aim was to not only **bring people together** from across the world but to also **encourage users** to **self improve** and **continue to learn new things** even **after** the **pandemic**.

Due to the **time constraints of this project**, this has been designed for a **typical desktop/laptop viewing window only**. Mobile responsiveness is a potential feature to be added in the future.

## Technologies üíª

- General:
    - **React**
    - **HTML5**
    - **SCSS**
    - **Bootstrap**
- Others:
    - **GitHub**
- 3rd party libraries/frameworks:
    - **Twilio Video API**
    - **Google Firebase**

## Process üìù
- We first discussed **everyone's experience, background** and **working styles** (given the **different timezones** of the team) before designating a **PM** and **brainstorming ideas**

- **Brainstormed ideas**:
  1. **Forum** targetted towards **'high-risk'/healthcare workers** posting their **needs** and **volunteers** offering to help
  2. **Virtual date/activities** platform
  3. **Activities hub** where people gather to spend time doing their **favorite activity/learn new one**

- **UX/UI process**:
  1. **Surveys** were conducted and **results analysed**
  2. **Wireframes drawn** and checked for **feasibility**

- **Developer process**:
  1. **Tech. Stack** decided
  2. **GitHub workflow**
  3. **Division of labor** (**FE and BE tasks delegation**)

- **Final presentation** practice and pitch

### MVP

- Users able to **register** and **sign in**
- **Onboarding page** where users select their **activities preferences**
- **Activities dashboard page**
- Users are able to enter **Video/Activity breakout rooms**

## Getting Started üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

To enjoy the **full experience** of the **site**, it is recommended to use the **deployed version** at [https://video-activity-hub.herokuapp.com/](https://video-activity-hub.herokuapp.com/). If you wish to **run it locally**, you will need to **follow the steps below**:

- **Fork** or **Clone** the **GitHub repository** ([https://github.com/ActivityHub/video-activity-hub](https://github.com/ActivityHub/video-activity-hub))
- In the **Root folder**, run `npm install` to **install** all the **dependencies**
- `npm start` to **start** the **development server** for the whole site

## Wins üèÜ

- We came **3rd place** overall.
- Incorporation of **Google Firebase authentication** => allowing for **social media sign in** (i.e. sign in with **Google**, **Facebook** etc)
- Managed to produce and present a **working web application**, that is **close to the wireframe designs** and **MVP product**

## Challenges üèãÔ∏è

The most challenging aspect of this project was **time management** and **communication** with other team members as we were all based in **different timezones** and only had **2 days to complete** this project.

Fortunately, we were very **organised** and ensured that everyone was **kept in the loop** about **current progress** and what needed to be done.

Technically, the **Twilio Video API** was quite a **steep learning curve** for 2 days, and it was **difficult** to **integrate our own back-end into theirs** so we ended up **adopted their back-end** and **building our front-end on top** of theirs.

## Future Work ‚òï

### Planned features/extensions

- Add **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Add **'Detailed' view** of **each activities** page
- Add **'filter by activity type' functionality** (currently search and filter only for display)
- **Profile page**
